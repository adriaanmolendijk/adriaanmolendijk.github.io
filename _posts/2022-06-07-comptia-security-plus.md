# What is the Comptia Security+?

According to the official Comptia website we have

> CompTIA Security+ is the first security certification a candidate should earn. It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs. Security+ incorporates best practices in hands-on troubleshooting, ensuring candidates have practical security problem-solving skills required to: 
> - **Assess** the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions
> - **Monitor and secure** hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, and IoT
> - **Operate** with an awareness of applicable laws and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance
> - **Identify, analyze, and respond** to security events and incidents
> 
> Security+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the US DoD to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation, because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 2.3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.

That is, the Comptia Security+ is an entry level cybersecurity certification. It aims to provide a baseline knowledge for people (like me) trying to pursue an IT security career. The certification covers a **massive** 1,037 topics (see links at end).

# What was my experience?

Studying for and taking the Comptia Security+ SY0-601 exam has definitely been a phenomenal experience. I learned a lot, and that is what matters the most to me. Let me share with you what I consider the good and the bad of the Security+ exam.

Good
- The Security+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the US DoD to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. 
- The Security+ is on the CISSP experience requirements list [https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/experience-requirements#](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/experience-requirements#). This means you may satisfy one year of required experience through holding the certification.
- The Security+ gives you a very wide and basic introduction to a variety of topics within security. Consider for example social engineering, attack types, application attacks, network attacks, threat intelligence, vulnerabilities, security assesements, penetration testing. These topics make up just one of the five domains covered in the certification.
- The exam objectives for the Comptia Security+ are listed on the exam website. Every possible topic that you could theoretically encounter on the exam can be found here. I myself used to this to my advantage by writing out and revising every definition that was on there before sitting the exam.
- The Security+ has been around for a while and Comptia certifications are well known. This means that there are plenty of study resources available, of which I at least recommend both Jason Dion and Professor Messer, see links at the end.
- Without violating my NDA: The exam was extremely fair (to my big surprise, I suppose I read too much reddit). I scored a 800/900 ~ 90%, and I thought both the multiple choice questions and the performance based questions were very doable. I had a couple of questions out of the about 85 questions overall that I thought were ambiguous or left up to interpretation, but this did not take away from the overall experience as you can tell.

Bad
- There is a price barrier to taking the examination. The cost of my exam was about 350 euros, excluding possible retake. Combine this with the fact that a passing score is 750/900 ~ 83%, with is very high IMO, this could be considered a risky investment.
- My total study time was 2 months, studying a couple of hours a day. Of course, study time varies immensely depending on your background, but I can assure you this is not the kind of exam you pass by taking a one week bootcamp.
- The Security+ gives you a very wide and basic introduction to a variety of topics within security. This means you will also need to know stuff about topics that are less relevant for your job or ambitions. I myself am less passionate about say hardware security or mobile device management, but knowledge of these topics is required. Know the differences between BYOD, CYOD, COPE, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 10, etc.
- The Security+ gives you a very wide and basic introduction to a variety of topics within security. This means you will not learn how to do a pentest. You will not learn how to configure a network. You will not learn about the software development lifecyle, how to set up PKI or how to harden operating systems. These are out of scope for the Comptia Security+, so if your goal is to obtain hands on/real life experience, this exam might not be the right one for you.

In my opinion, the Comptia Security+ certification gives you an excellent baseline for further studies in IT Security. I outlined several downsides of the Comptia Security+, which seem to be mitigated by the Comptia CySa+ ([https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)). This exam, which is more oriented towards cyber analysts, seems to be less wide in scope but more in depth. Who knows and maybe at some point, I will write a post about this exam as well ;).
