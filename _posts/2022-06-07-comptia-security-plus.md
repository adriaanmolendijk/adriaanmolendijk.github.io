In this post I describe my experience taking the Comptia Security+ SY0-601.

# What is the Comptia Security+?

According to the official Comptia website we have

> CompTIA Security+ is the first security certification a candidate should earn. It establishes the core knowledge required of any cybersecurity role and provides a springboard to intermediate-level cybersecurity jobs. Security+ incorporates best practices in hands-on troubleshooting, ensuring candidates have practical security problem-solving skills required to: 
> - **Assess** the security posture of an enterprise environment and recommend and implement appropriate security solutions
> - **Monitor and secure** hybrid environments, including cloud, mobile, and IoT
> - **Operate** with an awareness of applicable laws and policies, including principles of governance, risk, and compliance
> - **Identify, analyze, and respond** to security events and incidents
> 
> Security+ is compliant with ISO 17024 standards and approved by the US DoD to meet directive 8140/8570.01-M requirements. Regulators and government rely on ANSI accreditation, because it provides confidence and trust in the outputs of an accredited program. Over 2.3 million CompTIA ISO/ANSI-accredited exams have been delivered since January 1, 2011.

That is, the Comptia Security+ is an entry level cybersecurity certification. It aims to provide a baseline knowledge for people (like me!) trying to pursue an IT security career.
