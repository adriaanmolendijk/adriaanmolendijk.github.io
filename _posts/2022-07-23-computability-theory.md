In this post I will give a very short introduction to the field of Computability theory.


I got acquainted with Computability theory during my Master degree at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). There I wrote my dissertation on this exact topic, which can be found at one of the links at the bottom of the post.

# What is computability theory?

## The motivation

According to Wikipedia we have

That is, Computability theory is an academic field that falls within the broader theoretical computer science and mathematical philosophy. Computability theory tries to address the following questions:
- What does it mean for a function over the natural numbers to be computable?
- How can noncomputable functions be classified into a hierarchy based on their level of noncomputability?

I always like to compare these questions to the one(s) that are addressed by Computation theory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation)). Computation theory tries to address the question
- Given a problem X, what are the resources needed to solve said problem?

As you can see, the questions are fundamentally different. While Computation theory really tries to understand the **resources** needed to solve a problem (often optimally), Computability theory tries to understand the fundamental limitations of what can be computed at all.
