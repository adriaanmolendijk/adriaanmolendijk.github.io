In this post I will give my thoughts on the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge v4 (CCSK).

# What is the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)?

According to the official Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) website we have

> As organizations migrate to the cloud, they need information security professionals who are cloud-savvy. The CCSK certificate is widely recognized as the standard of expertise for cloud security and gives you a cohesive and vendor-neutral understanding of how to secure data in the cloud. The CCSK credential is the foundation to prepare you to earn additional cloud credentials specific to certain vendors or job functions.
> 
> Earning the CCSK will provide you with the knowledge to effectively develop a holistic cloud security program relative to globally accepted standards. It covers key areas, including best practices for IAM, cloud incident response, application security, data encryption, SecaaS, securing emerging technologies, and more. If you want to learn more, you can read our guide to earning the CCSK. 

That is, the Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) gives students to the ability to utilize cloud services more securely and speak with confidence about cloud security concerns. The training material covers the CSA Security guidance v.4, the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) and the ENISA's Cloud Computing Risk Assessment (see links at the end). The domains covered in the certification are the following

- Cloud Computing Concepts
- Governance & Enterprise Risk Management
- Legal Issues: Contracts and Electronic Discovery
- Compliance & Audit Management
- Information Governance
- Management Plane & Business Continuity
- Infrastructure Security
- Virtualization & Containers
- Incident Response
- Application Security
- Data Security & Encryption
- Identity Entitlement and Access Management
- Security as a Service
- Related Technologies
- CCM
- ENISA

# What are my thoughts?

Studying for and taking the CCSK has been a pleasant experience. Let me share with you my thoughts on what I consider the good and the bad of the certificate.

Good
- The CCSK is on the CCSP experience requirements list [https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP/experience-requirements](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP/experience-requirements). This means you may satisfy one year of required experience through holding the certification.
- The CCSK does not expire, you are certified for life. This is a philosophy that I actually find myself disagreeing with. However, that being said, you can use this in combination with the previous bullet point to your advantage.
- The CCSK is the market leader when it comes to vendor agnostic cloud security. The vendor specific ones, such as the Azure Security Engineer, seem to be much more product specific and often very commercialized. On the other hand, the vendor agnostic CCSP from (ISC)^2 also looks like a great certification, but this one has a huge entry requirement and is much more strategic / less tactical in nature.
- The CCSK is not a big investment effort wise. The primary source of information for the exam is the 150 page security guidance, and that's about it. Read the book two times thoroughly and you are pretty much good to go. To put in perspective, the time I invested into my Comptia Security+ certification was about 8x as much.

Bad
- Reputation wise this certificate will not get you very far. It is neither widely recognized like a Comptia Security+, nor is it is very advanced like some of the professional vendor specific cloud certifications.

I learned quite some and enjoyed the certificate. In my opinion, the best reasons to pursue the CCSK is to either (1) broaden or strengthen your foundational knowledge of cloud security (2) use this in your roadmap to obtaining the CCSP. That is what I am doing ;).
